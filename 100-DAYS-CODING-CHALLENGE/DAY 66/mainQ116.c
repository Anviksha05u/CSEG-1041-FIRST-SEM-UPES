//Write a program to take an integer array nums which contains only positive integers, and an integer target as inputs. The goal is to find two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] + nums[j] equals the target. Assume exactly one solution exists and return the indices in any order. Print the two indices separated by a space as output. If no solution exists, print "-1 -1".
